-----------------


 root component file  is where you UI components placed ,ex. App.jsx
 entry points file where the root file is gonna render with render code , ex. main.jsx

 JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.

 #### Rule of JSX

 1. to return multiple element from a component ,wrap them with  a single parent tag

 like : <div></div>

 if you don't wonna use div use
empty tag also called as /*fragment*/
 <></>

 2. you should close all tags 


 #1.  <li>
  => <li></li>

#2. if element is self closing use 
like this 
    <img>
 =>  <img />

 3.  Use camelCase all most of the things! except component name which start with capital



 #### JSX with Curly Braces
@passing string with quotes
ex.
  function App() {

  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = "Gregorio Y. Zara";

  return (
    <>
      <img className='avatar' src={avatar} alt={description} />
      <h1> this is image of {description}</h1>


  );
}
You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing " and " with { and }


you can also use function inside {}
ex.⤵️⤵️
  const today = new Date();

  function formatDate(date) {
    return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(
      'en-US',
      { weekday: 'long' }
    ).format(date);
  }

  export default function TodoList() {
    return (
      <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1>
    );
  }

  Where to use curly braces 
You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:

if you wonna  concate string so you can concate 
src = {baseUrl+imageId+'.jpg'}



As text directly inside a JSX tag: <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1> works, but <{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara's To Do List</{tag}> will not.
As attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src="{avatar}" will pass the string "{avatar}".

@ Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX
person = {{name:"erwin shrodinger",occupation:"scientist"}}
this passes whole object 

#### Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the props you can pass to an <img>

in html it called attributes
in jsx it called props

@passing prop to components
<img
  src="link"
  alt="description"
  width="100px"

  />
in this given tag src alt and width are props

you can pass props tho your component
function avatar({link,alt,description}){
  return(
    <>
      <img
        src={link}
         alt={description}
         width={100px}
       />
    </>
  )
}

function App(){
  <>
    <avatar 
      link=alkdhadkjadfkladhf
      description=this is description
      width =100
    />
  </>
}
use curly braces incomponent parameter to take input as prop.
App(para)<--reads function's parameter
App({prop,prop2})<-- reads component's prop 

@like function's parameter you can define the default prop 
value

App({prop1='link',prop2=26}){}

here's props default value 

@Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax
some parent component uses child components 
so this syntax is used to give child component all props

@Passing JSX as children 

<div><img ....../></div>

you can also nest your component

####Conditional Rendering
@Conditional returning jsx
if(packed){
  return(
    <>
     <h1>product ✅</h1> 
    </>
  )
}
return(
    <>
     <h1>product [not packed]</h1> 
    </>
  )

  or you can use ternary operator
  return(
    {packed?<><h1>product ✅</h1> </> :<><h1>product</h1> </>}
  )

@Logical AND operator (&&) 
A JavaScript && expression returns the value of its right side (in our case, the checkmark) 
if the left side (our condition) is true. But if the condition is false, the whole expression 
becomes false. React considers false as a “hole” in the JSX tree, just like null or undefined, 
and doesn’t render anything in its place.

The AND operator has a higher precedence than the OR operator, meaning the && operator is executed before the || operator (see operator precedence).

function Item({name,isPacked}){
  return(
    <>
    <li className='item'>
      {name}{isPacked&&"👍"}
      //in this && is not strictly boolean operator
      //if left side is true then returns rigth side value
      //if left side is false then return left side value
      //left side value is false 
      ⤵️⤵️⤵️⤵️
      //REACT IGNORES FALSE VALUES SHOWING NOTHING
      👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆
      // if you want visible result also with false use ternary operator
    </li>
    </>
  )
}
function App(){
  return (
    <>
    <h1>silly's space Advanture</h1>
    
    <Item name="spacesuit" isPacked={false}/>
    <Item name="waterSupply" isPacked/><---- isPacked does exist = true 
    <Item name="food" /><----isPacked doesn't exist = false
    </>
  )
}


### passing child componet into parent 
use children prop it is given below 
---------------------------------------------
function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <div className="card-content">
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h1>Photo</h1>
        <img
          className="avatar"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/OKS67lhm.jpg"
          alt="Aklilu Lemma"
          width={100}
          height={100}
        />
      </Card>
      <Card>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Aklilu Lemma was a distinguished Ethiopian scientist who discovered a natural treatment to schistosomiasis.</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
--------------------------------------------------

or pass components as prop 

function Card({ content }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {content}
    </div>
  );
}
 
function App(){
<Card content={<Profile />} />
<Card content={<About />} />
}

or pass the components as component
function Card ({component})
{
  return (
    <div className='card'>
      <component />
    </div>
  )
}

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children`                                      | Wrapping content inside component                       |
| Component as JSX prop (`content={<Profile />}`) | You need multiple content areas                         |
| Component function prop (`Component={Profile}`) | You need to control when component renders or rerenders |


React treats components like values.

Arrays aren't primitive in java .it can contain multiple datatype .

using .map or .filter method to manipulate Arrays

const people = [
        'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
        'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
        'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
        'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
        'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
    ];
function App() {
    
    const list=people.map(n=><li>{n}</li>)///this technique also called implicit return
    return(
        <>
            <ul>{list}</ul>
        </>
    )
    or 
    return(
        <>
            <ul>{people.map(n=><li>{n}</li>)} </ul>
        </>
    )
}


key are unique numbers.
Key's Rule
1.key must be unique
2.key myst not change.don't generate them while Rendering

why to use key 
File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.

Note that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.

🔥 KEY IDEA

map() is NOT responsible for displaying elements.

👉 map() creates an array of JSX elements
👉 React displays them


Purity: Components as formulas 
In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the following characteristics:

It minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.

In React, side effects usually belong inside event handlers. Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined inside your component, they don’t run during rendering! So event handlers don’t need to be pure.

If you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a useEffect call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. However, this approach should be your last resort.

| ❌ BAD                            | Why                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Updating state during render      | Causes infinite loop  |
| Calling API inside render         | Side effect           |
| Reading/writing localStorage      | Mutates external data |
| Modifying props                   | Breaks React rules    |
| Randomizing values on each render | Makes UI inconsistent |


✨ Simple rule to remember

Rendering must be pure. Effects must be in useEffect.

Any code that:

Changes something outside component

Reads something that can change over time

Triggers async actions
→ belongs in effects (useEffect), NOT inside render
